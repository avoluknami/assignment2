//The Book class contains four attributes: title, author, ISBN, and price. It includes two constructors:
 a default constructor that initializes these attributes to default values and a parameterized constructor
  for setting specific values. The displayInfo() method outputs the details of the book, while the applyDiscount()
   method decreases the price based on a specified percentage. In the main method, three Book objects are instantiated
    (one with default values and two with specific values). The displayInfo() method is called to show their details, and 
    applyDiscount() is used to apply a discount to the price of one book. This structure effectively meets the assignment's requirements.
